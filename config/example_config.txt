		Add as many servers as you need, each server added needs its own bot created at https://discord.com/developers/
		pay close attention to quotes and commas in this config file. every line in a list of settings gets commas except for the last line in the list of settings
		also at the end of each servers list of settings in this servers section gets a comma unless its the last server in the servers section than it does not get a comma.
